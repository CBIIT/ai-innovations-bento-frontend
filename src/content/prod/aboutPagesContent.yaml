    - paragraph: "Bento is an open source framework developed by the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research to support data sharing. It provides a structure to enable groups to quickly stand up and then configure a data sharing environment for life science data - groups can use Bento to share data amongst themselves or with a larger community. Bento's reference implementation contains a data model that is compatible with the Cancer Research Data Commons' Harmonized model (CRDC-H) such that Bento instances can be connected into and inter-operate with the CRDC. Users can customize the data model for their own needs. Bento also contains a User Interface and an API for programmatic access."

    - paragraph: "https://dev.bento-tools.org/.gov/v1/graphql/"
    - paragraph: "The BENTO metadata is open to the public and will not require authentication to the system. However, some clinical data and all Data Files are not public so require permission."
    - paragraph: "Users can query the BENTO data via Graphical User Interface (GUI) or API. The GUI provides users a distilled set of parameters (faceted querying) they can use to explore a subset of the CTDC data model. The API provide access to the full collection of parameters as seen in the $$[CTDC Data Model](https://github.com/CBIIT/ctdc-codebase)$$."
    - paragraph: "The API is provided “as is”; there are no warranties or conditions arising out of usage of these services. "

    - paragraph: "As a resource for the public and cancer research, $$[the BENTO GitHub repo](https://github.com/CBIIT/bento-frontend)$$ is available for research,
        usage, forking, and pull requests. The codebase is intended for sharing and building frameworks for related initiatives 
        and projects. The BENTO GitHub repo has documentation about how to access the system, including endpoints and recommendations for 
        tools and example queries. Both the project and documentation are currently maintained and updated. "
    - paragraph: "BENTO is based on a Graph database, and features a GraphQL API (Java) and a React front-end (JavaScript). 
        Each tier in the application stack is designed to be modular and adaptable for a variety of use-cases and scenarios. "
